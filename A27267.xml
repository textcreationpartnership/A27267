            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT becomes every man, about to tranſcribe, or render the Works of another in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tongue, neither to add any thing of his own, nor to omit of the Author's; leaſt in ſo doing, he ſhould maim the ſame by abſtracting, or render them monſtrous by impertinent additions. Wherefore, avoiding theſe extreams, I offer this Little work, (not gorgeouſly adorned with paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Rhetorick, but plainly cloathed in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Habit) to the Searchers into the wondrous Myſterys of Nature, by them to be viewed, and reviewed, to be approved, or condemned (if any thing herein may justly be cenſured) as they ſhall think fit. Yet, I would not have any Man to perſwade himſelf, that I preſent This <hi>Tyrocini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> as a Guide to the moſt Experienced, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a neceſsary auxiliary to Pupils, and ſuch as are deſirous to enter upon the <hi>Praxis</hi> of this Laudable Science, but hitherto, perhaps for want of Expert knowledge of the Latin Tongue, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not finding experienced Maſters, could not

Therefore if you find benefit by the peruſal hereof, extol not the Author, nor commend the Tranſlator, but praiſe God, who is the Giver of all good Gifts, and by whom all Sciences were communicated to the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi>

For as to ſweetneſs, or pleaſure in taking, it muſt needs be granted,<note place="margin">Chymical Medicines are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the vulgar.</note> that the ſick will ſooner take Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, with which 4 grains of Mercury, working by ſeidge, only are commixed, than many drams of <hi>Diacatholicon:</hi> and will more willingly take one only of the bleſſed Pills of <hi>Quercetanus,</hi> or two Pills of his <hi>Panchyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogon</hi> Electuary, than 10, or 15, without them, of gilded and fetid Pills, or four grains of Mineral <hi>Bezoar,</hi> of the moſt famous Dr. <hi>Hartmannus,</hi> or eight grains of Diaphoretick Antimony of <hi>Crollius,</hi> than any other Sudorifick potion: And much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little of the Cream or Magiſtery of Tartar, than an agoniſtick draught of Apozeme or Syrup of any <hi>Magiſtrale,</hi> laboriouſly confected according to a deſcription of I know not how many foot long.</p>
               <p>Yet in a ſenſe the Potions and Veſſels of vulgar Medicaments, do in odour far exceed the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; namely, when the Sick, only hearing of them before they take then in their hands, with the nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imagination of their taſte and odour, being not provoked with any magnetick force, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, purge upward, and downward, which hitherto by Chymical Medicaments could not be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>They ſay, Spagyrick Artificers glory in the ſweetneſs of their Remedies, but Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51502:8"/> in the ſhops of Apothecarys, have obtained the praiſe of ſalubrity and ſafeneſs of Curation. For, ſay they, your Remedies are not more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and more ſafe than ours, being not enough ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious or ſafe: ſince yours for the moſt part are venomous and plainly repugnant to humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as being Metallick and taken from Minerals; and generally are more ſharp, more corroſive, and more hot than is convenient, and alſo very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmell of the fire. Theſe indeed are forcible weapons, and are ready to caſt down the ſtrong-hold of Chymiſts, if they be not dexterouſly ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with the Buckler of Reaſon and Experience. It can ſcarcely be denyed, but that moſt of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are taken from out of the family of Minerals and Metals. But if the Ancient and famous Phyſicians did not only uſe them,<note place="margin">Chymical Medicines are not venomous and repugnant to humane Nature although Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick.</note> but crude and unprepared, as in the preſcriptions of <hi>Galen, Dioſcorides,</hi> and in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotory of <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Myrepſicum,</hi> and others is to this day to be ſeen, and ſome moſt famous Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of late time, as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> uſed crude Mercury in P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51502:8"/> ſince we have ſeen thoſe, who, with vulgar Medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caments of the Apothecarys, could not recover a perfect ſtate of Health; yet at the perſwaſion of the ſame Miſochymiſts have removed themſelves to Metallick Baths, or Mineral fountains through the continued uſe of which, they have been perfectly cured. Whence we indeed may rightly conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that in Minerals and Metallicks of this kind, there are concluded a certain fixed Balſom, and moſt potent Spirits, not obnoxious to corruption. The ſame alſo in the uſe of Chyrurgical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is conſpicuous; for of their Remedys is ſcarce any of great virtue, unleſs with it ſome Metal o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So at length from thence may Remedies be taken apt for the Cure of moſt deplorable diſeaſes, quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly, if they be adhibited by learned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and circumſpect Phyſicians, and according to the preſcribed Rules of <hi>Therapeia.</hi> The Viper, a beaſt moſt venomous, being rightly prepared, is the <hi>Baſis</hi> of Treacle, that univerſal <hi>Alexipharmacon,</hi> approved by the Experience of ſo many Ages. So we ſee daily, that from vulgar Serpents, they now commonly prepare a moſt certain preventionary and curative Medicine againſt venoms of every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51502:9"/> kind. Likewiſe the Sea-Dragon, which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Lavive,</hi> hath in his back a Bone, which being taken out, thence is made a moſt delicate food. In the ſame manner alſo things dug out of the Earth, may plainly be reduced to that Nature of Mediocrity, the whole being reſolved into diſtinct parts, and the malignant and mortiferous qualities removed; that moſt certainly, thoſe, who rightly uſe ſuch, legitimately prepared, admit not a mortal enemy, but a friendly Gueſt, not a poyſonous ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, but an <hi>Alexapharmacon,</hi> and Antidote againſt all diſeaſes into the penetrales of their life. For if the venemoſity of Metals and Minerals depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their form; who ſees not, if theſe by Chymical Artifice be reſolved into their three principles, that their deadly and deſtructive qualities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved? And if you ſhall conceive the malignity to be eſtabliſhed in any of the undivided parts, you will ſo much the eaſier underſtand, that when the whole is divided into parts, that may be ſegrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And in this manner is the correction of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferous medicaments; which, how ſafe, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious it is, might be proved by infinite Examples, if we thought it were not ſufficiently known al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>Let therefore Miſochymiſts forbear to abhor the uſe of Minerals and Metals, to be exhibited inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally into the humane body; and unadviſedly to fear I know not what, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, thence to proceed; but let them rather learn of Chymiſts the true way of ſubduing the malignity of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which venerable Antiquity uſed (as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Mercury, both kinds of Hellebore, all the Species of <hi>Tithymalus, Pytyuſa, Elaterium, Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, Euphorbium, Thapſia, Seammony, Thymelaea,</hi> the

For he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſo to diſſipate, and infringe the venomous qualities of Simples, is not unlike to fooliſh and ignorant Cooks, who, when Carps are to be ſcaled, and boweled, contend that if the choler or bag of the gall ſhall happen to be broke, it is not to be waſhed out, or ſegregated, but with Honey or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to be corrected, and its evil ſavour ſo remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: or if they be to prepare the inteſtines of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals for mans food, ſhall fooliſhly judge that the ſordid and filthy excrements are not to be waſhed away, but that they are to boiled as they are, with the addition of Amber, or odoriferous Oils poured upon them.</p>
               <p>Spagyrick Remedies ſeem not to be wholeſome and ſafe, becauſe they are ſharp and corroſive, and by the violence of fire rendred more Coſtick, and becauſe they ſmell of the fire: but if they be (or while they are) ſharp and corroſive, they are not to be received into the body. Good GOD! how great a quantity of Medicaments ought to be caſt out from the vulgar <hi>Pharmacopoly's?</hi> How great is the number of them to be expunged from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotary's? And how many Condiments are to be removed from their Kitchins? <hi>Cantharides</hi> by <hi>Galen</hi> are numbred among dangerous Medicines, which by eroſion kill; and they are to be but ſparingly taken; and unto theſe he grants it is behoveful they ſhould be commixed, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The juices of Lemmons and Citrons diſſove the moſt firm bodies of Pearls and Corrals; yet in the <hi>Cardiack</hi> paſſion, and in extream imbecility, and decay of ſtrength, a more ready and excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, is not vulgarly given. Therefore the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Coſtick force of Chymical Remedies is not to be forced, eſpecially, ſince many are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly corroding, which inwardly cannot exerciſe their force, not only by reaſon of greater repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the inteſtines, and the vegetate ſtrength of the native heat; but alſo by reaſon of the noxious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors reſiding in the Stomach. As we devour not whole handfuls of Salt, nor uſe we certain pounds of it in broths, but, it may be, we diſſolve of it one pugil; and a little Vinegar and Spice we are wont to uſe for ſeaſoning our meats; ſo when neceſſity compels, ſpagyrick Phyſicians to the uſing of ſharp Medicaments, they exhibit ſome drops, or one grain or two, not alone, but mixed with appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Liquors. Yea, the moſt ſharp may be ſo well odulcorated, as they may depoſite all their acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;<note place="margin">Chymical Medicines are not dangerous, by reaſon of their ſharpneſs contracted by fire.</note> which in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> is clearly evinced, if with them Salt of Tartar be commixed.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the Contagion of fire, which is by them objected, it is a thing ſo vain and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as needs no refutation. <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf in the 18. Chap. <hi>de Theriaca ad Piſonem,</hi> expreſly writeth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51502:10"/> that the fire doth meliorate many things, and ſometimes diſcovers the hidden nature of things, and ſome things alſo it renders apt for uſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our intention. Whence alſo the ſame Element by <hi>Cicero,</hi> is not undeſervedly honoured with the Title of Maſter of Arts, likewiſe <hi>Galen</hi> ſubjects ſharp and biting Minerals to the <hi>Examen</hi> of fire, that they may be rendred more gentle. He eſteems<note n="*" place="margin">Red Vitriol.</note> 
                  <hi>Chalcitis</hi> burnt, better than not burnt. <hi>Balanus Myrepſica,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Meſue,</hi> provokes vomiting, and alſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth dejections by the inferiour parts; but being burnt, and the nauſeous humidity thereof removed, the only force of expelling humours by Seidge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. So ſublimate Mercury, which is moſt ſharp, abiding the violence of fire with Antimony, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a moſt gentle, and moſt wholſome <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exipharmacon.</hi> Likewiſe Iron, when calcined into <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> with fire of reverberation ſuſtaineth the extreameſt heat of flames, yet they on it impreſs no acrimony to hinder the uſe thereof from being moſt profitable, as it is moſt frequent in <hi>Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagia's,</hi> and other Fluxes. On the contrary, how great ſharpneſs do the Water and Oil of Cinnamon acquire in a <hi>Balneum</hi> of vapour only? And in the ſame, how much is Wine made more acid? Whence is this? Can you underſtand the Reaſon? You may, if you can comprehend why the Sun hardens clay, and ſoftens wax; and the ſame makes lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen white,<note place="margin">Whence is the acrimony of Chymical Medicaments.</note> but blackens the face. You are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deceived, if you think Spirit of Vitriol con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51502:11"/> acrimony from external heat: and ſo if you judge that Oil of Salt from the fire of Reverberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is infected with the ſame; for if Salts were not inſited and mixed in theſe, you by the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of fire, could never be able to inure ſuch a ſharpneſs. And contrarywiſe, ſhould you uſe the moſt moderate heat that could be in ſome things, yet you ſhall undoubtedly render them more ſharp, by reaſon of the force of preſent Salts. Moreover for the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreuma</hi> of Chymical Medicines,<note place="margin">Chymical Remedies ſmell not of the fire.</note> it is not of ſuch moment, as under that name they ſhould ſeem violent and dangerous to practical Phyſicians: for if ſuch a thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in thoſe Medicaments, it took its beginning either from a moderate or ſtrong heat. If from that, and therefore Chymical Remedies are cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for obnoxious; then can neither our Meats, or Drinks, or vulgar Medicaments be ſafe and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; ſince, in preparing them, oftentimes a greater degree of fire is required than for Spagyrick Remedies, which is manifeſt in the making of Beer or Ale, where the Mault is firſt with ſtrong fire dryed, afterward boiled with greater. And alſo in ſome Rheniſh Wines, which by reaſon of their wholſomneſs, are uſed by the Northern people in almoſt all diſeaſes, inſtead of a Remedy; and yet to a true maturity, they cannot be brought, but by the benefit of Elementary fite; alſo in broiled fiſh, and ſmoak dryed, roaſted, and boiled fleſh, with many other ſuch like. But if from this,<note place="margin">The <hi>Empyreuma</hi> how it may be corrected.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> from violent fire, yet thence cannot any thing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51502:11"/> of peril happen to the ſick, ſince either with abluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or digeſtion it may be corrected; as is ſeen in aſhes, which water being poured on them, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the notes of their calidity received from the fire in a <hi>Lixivium.</hi> Yea, ablution often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, renders ſome purging Metallicks and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Chymically prepared, inefficacious for exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depraved humours. How by decoction all things are made ſweet is known, yet there ſeemed to be need of inducing an Enſample to prove the ſame. If by an <hi>Empyrenma,</hi> you ſhall happen thus to underſtand; that when either the potential heat, which is latent in the mixture, as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der coals, is produced into act by violent fire, and ſo freed from all impediment, exerciſeth more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent force; or when the heat, which therein was diſperſed, is united by the benefit of fire; for this cauſe, neither an <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> nor too much heat is to be feared; ſince it is the office of a Phyſician rightly to uſe hot things of this kind, as alſo others [leſs hot] which if imprudently adhibited, may unavoidably infer detriment to the ſick.

Moreover, is it not neceſſary, that as well Animals as Vegetables, ſhould be deprived of that life whereby they live, that is, are nouriſhed, grow, and encreaſe, that they may be rendred apt for the food, and uſe of man? For even the barbarous <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> although they feed on fleſh, either crude or heated by hunting with the ſwift courſing of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet will they not take the beaſts alive into their Mouths, and tear their fleſh, and eat it. So alſo it is expedient, that Plants, Sprouts, and Fruits ſhould die, that they may give forth vital actions in the humane body; that is, they muſt be taken from their Native Soil or Root, leaſt thence they ſhould ſtill attract aliment for conſerving their life, that they may be made apt Remedies for conſerving the health of men, and expelling their diſeaſes.

With ſuch precipitates of Chymiſts, it is no wonder if they that uſe them be precipited into the Grave. If ſome improvident and prodigal of their own health follow after their Mercurys of life, they follow not life, but death, which they ſometimes buy at a very great rate.</p>
               <p>Then the blame of ſo grievous accidents, doth not ſeldom redound to thoſe alſo who adminiſter the ſaid Medicaments, ſome of whom never ſaw the legitimate uſe of them; others of them are plainly unlearned, ſtupid, and ignorant of the whole method of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hyppocrates:</hi> Such are like to Jews and Patricides, whoſe Religion is no other than after the manner of Thieves, to ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51502:14"/> in others ruine. For like reaſon, the ſame is ſometimes written of vulgar Medicines, and ſuch as are of moſt potent virtues, as the Scammoneate, Helleborate, and ſuch like; when by unskilful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarys they are ſiniſtrouſly prepared, or by the expert, dexterouſly conſected, but by Empyricks prepoſterouſly uſed, although the ſame Medicaments may be of excellent uſe, if well prepared, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically adhibited.</p>
               <p>There is no reaſon therefore, that learned and prudent Phyſicians ſhould abſtain any longer from the uſe of Chymical Remedies, ſince, if they be confected by expert Artiſts (among whom in <hi>France, Nicholas Bonne</hi> is famous, the Apothecary of the moſt illuſtrious Duke of <hi>Bullion</hi> in <hi>Arce Sedanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi,</hi> who hath a ſhop compleatly furniſhed with moſt choice Remedies, as well Galenical as Spagyrical, eſpecially Treacles, both the common and eſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, according to the Rules of <hi>Quercetanus,</hi> moſt exquiſitely and faithfully prepared;) all malignity, if any be in their nature, is removed by the benefit of Vulcan; ſo as it is impoſſible, if they be metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically uſed, that they ſhould either deſtroy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat and Spirits, (the individual guards of the Soul) or infer on the principal parts a depraved diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>And thus hitherto is ſhown, how under a falſe pretext Chymical Remedies are as it were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unprofitable, and peſtiferous: and ſo the Cities right in the Re-publique of Medicine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
               <p>Now, that they are more wholſome, and more ſafe than the vulgar, is to be proved; which indeed by what hath been already ſaid, is ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51502:14"/> nevertheleſs, that all things may be the better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of,<note place="margin">Spagyrick Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are more wholſome, and more ſafe than the vulgar.</note> ſome few things to back our aſſertion ſeem to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Remedies prepared by the Spagyrick Art, are therefore more ſalubrious, and more ſafe than the vulgar, or the ſame after the common and vulgar manner prepared; becauſe in them the pure is ſeparated from the impure, the <hi>Alexipharmacon</hi> from the malignity, the Corporeal from the Spiritual, and the unprofitable from the commodious; and ſo with their bulkineſs they oppreſs not the Stomach, nor do they delay or defer their Operations, but immediately begin to aſſault the Diſeaſes, and ſpeedily compel them to forſake their ſtrong-holds in humane bodies. So Beer that hath ſufficiently purged, is better and more wholſome, than what hath not purged. Wine cleanſed from its Tartar, is more ſafely drunk, than Wine newly preſt from the Grape. So food, the Excrements ſecluded by nature after many Cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nouriſh all the members of our bodies. Sooner doth the water or Balſom of Cinnamon in ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings refreſh the Spirits, than the Cinnamon whole. Likewiſe ſome drops of Oil of Aniſe are more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, than whole Ounces of the ſame unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But the vulgar mind deſpiſeth all preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and had rather uſe things whole, than diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into their principles; wherefore he adhibits Medicines partly not ſufficient or convenient; whence it often happens, that the ſick having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the noxious, excrementitious, and venomous parts together, with the ſalubrious and profitable, the Diſeaſe being overcome, they are ſoon after af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with ſymptoms more grievous, and more dangerous than the diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51502:15"/>
               <p>Moreover, who knows not that Chymical wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters retain the intire odour, and taſte of Vegetables, but the vulgar waters are no other than unprofitable phlegm, and waters eaſily putrefying; and thoſe will dure many years, but theſe ſcarcely a Moneth or two. And as the vulgar waters of <hi>Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly's</hi> acquire an extream malignity from the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den veſſels; ſo their decoctions in Copper veſſels are no leſs contaminated, which are ſo much the worſe alſo, becauſe in their preparation, the more ſubtile and better parts vaniſh into Air, and a little after, through mouldineſs contracted, they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and rendred unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Alſo their Reſtoratives and Cordials, which are prepared of Corals and Pearls reduced to powder, and ſifted, as alſo of foliate Gold; what other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue do they manifeſt in the humane body, than the incruſting of the Ventricle, and otherwiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it more languiſhed, and unapt to perform its office? Whereas, on the contrary, Quinteſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chymiſts and Magiſterys by them confected, as alſo Tinctures of Gold made without Corroſives, eaſily diſſolved in any Liquor; theſe ſo diſſolved, being admitted into the body, renew decayed ſtrength, and reſtore to priſtine vigour. Alſo vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Medicaments in Chronical diſeaſes, ſeldom produce the deſired effects; being only taken from Vegetables, with which they are unable totally to extirpate, and pluck up the ſetled Roots of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious affects. But Chymical Remedies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe prepared of Metals and Minerals, being of more potent force, and of great efficacy, do throughly cure Diſtempers vulgarly uncureable, as the epilepſie, leproſie, quartane fever, gout, Dropſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Mercury<note place="margin">Mercury.</note> is that Acid, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable, penetrable, Aethereal, and moſt pure Liquor, whence is all nutrition, ſenſe, motion, virtues, colours, and the retardation of over haſty age.

               <p>Moreover, every mixt body may be, and by us is reſolved into theſe three principles (ſo according to the Pythagoreans, every thing, and all things are terminated in three) fixed in the ſacred Ternary. Although this might be proved by weighty reaſons, yet ocular and evident inſpection doth far exceed all theſe. Therefore, by examples taken from the various kind of mixt things, we ſhall, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of young Beginners, delucidate every thing. We will firſt begin with green Woods, which if you burn, there will come forth a certain Waterineſs, which is plainly unapt for taking flame; and if ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered when converted into fume, it is reſolved ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily into water (and by the ſame reaſon, to ſeek drink from a flame is not impoſſible) and this is called Mercury: then there goes forth an oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtance eaſily inflamable, which reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vapours, if taken, will paſs into Oil, and that is called Sulphur: at length a dry and terreſtrial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance remains, which from the aſhes, by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of water is extracted, and in the humid and cold it is diſſolved, but in heat congealed, and it obtains the name of Salt. So Milk contains a Sulphureous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51502:17"/> buttery ſubſtance, then Mercurial Whey, and at length ſaline Cheeſe, or Curds. In Eggs, the White exhibits Mercury, the Yolk Sulphur, the Skins and Shells Salt. In like manner from Linſeed we draw Oil by expreſſion; Water by ſeparation from the Oil; and Salt from the remaining feces, by extraction. By like reaſon from Cloves a moſt famous Mercurial water, a moſt excellent Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Oil, and from the feces a Salt is extracted. So Nitre is divided into aquoſity, fatneſs, and Salt. No otherwiſe of Sea Salt do we produce Mercury <gap reason="foreign">

Of Antimony a <hi>Regulus</hi> is made, which is the Mercury thereof; then a Red Sulphur conceiving flame; and at length a Salt, which is vomitive. And thus may you of all other things judge the ſame.</p>

               <p>Amalgamation is the corroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Metal by Mercury.<note place="margin">Amalgamation.</note> And this is done when a Metal filed ſmall, or beat out into very thin plates, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with eight parts of Mercury, or eight times its own weight of ☿, that it may be a Maſs every where like unto it (and be as one body) for diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the unity of that Metal: for the <hi>Hydrargyry</hi> being evaporated over a fire, the Metal is left like unto a thin Calx.</p>
               <p>Precipitation is a corroſion by ſtrong and corroſive Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">Precipitation.</note> and that is done when bodies are emerged in corroſive Liquor, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being corroded or diſſolved, either by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of the Water, or ſome other way, they are repercuſſed into a Calx.</p>

Afterward put coals round about, or give it fire of Reverberation, encreaſing

               <p>EXtraction is a kind of Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,<note place="margin">Extraction general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered.</note> wherein the more ſubtile parts are ſeparated from the more groſs.</p>
               <p>And is twofold, either generally, or ſpecially, ſo called:</p>
               <p>Generally, ſo called, is made duplicitly, as well by aſcenſion and deſcenſion, as by an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</p>
               <p>And that is either dry or humid: the dry is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation, the other is called diſtillation.</p>
               <p>Sublimation<note place="margin">Sublimation.</note> is an extraction of the more ſubtile dry parts, by fire elevated aloft, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the veſſel.</p>
               <p>It is made, when the matter to be ſublimed is aptly prepared, as it ought to be, <hi>viz.</hi> either by waſhing, or by calcination, parching, cocting, or the like; and afterward either alone, or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter permixt, put into an Urinal with a Spherick, or large and broad bottom, ſo as half part of the veſſel only may be filled, and that placed in an aludel [or pan] over a furnace quite above the fire, and unto the veſſel a Blind-head Luted on with good Luting, in the Head muſt be a hole directly over the middle of the inferior veſſel, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid Spirits may exhale through the hole. Then muſt fire be gradually adhibited, and when all the humidity hath expired (which may be proved by a piece of glaſs, or a ſmooth plate of Iron, when apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51502:20"/> to the hole, if not at all ſtained with the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the hole of the Alembeck cloſed with Luting, and the fire intended for forcing the Spirits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Therefore, according to <hi>Geber,</hi> Sublimation is the elevation of a dry matter by fire, with adheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the ſides of the veſſel; how madly are diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and calcination confounded, and waters which are diſtilled, faid to be ſublimed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is obſervable, that this Chymical Operation is not a new invention, but it was alſo known to the ancients. For ſo <hi>Cadmia</hi> or Braſs-oar was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore prepared, witneſs <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides;</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Pompholyx</hi> and <hi>Spodium,</hi> by the ſame teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Diſtillation<note place="margin">Diſtillation.</note> is an extraction of the humid parts, extenuate and elevate into fume by heat.</p>

                  </gap>, that is, Art imitates nature, is verified in this vulgar Operation of practical Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry. For as vapours by the Solar rays are drawn up from the Earth into the middle Region of Air, and there condenſed by the coldneſs of that Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sphere, fall down again upon the Earth in ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. So the Chymical Artificer, from things exhaleable and vapourable, by the miniſtry of fire, with ſeparation of the thin Spirits from the more groſs parts, and elevation of them unto the cold concaveneſs of the head, extracts their eſſence in form of Liquor. Likewiſe in the humane body<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> exhalations from the inferior parts are carryed upward into the Airy Region of the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm, as into an Alembeck, and by the coldneſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51502:20"/> thereof, are condenſed into a phlegmatick and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſe Excrement, whence afterward is made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued diſtillation and defluction thereof into the Noſtrils, Pallate, or other parts of the body. Hence it is, that in dreſſing of Meats we cloſe our Pots with covers, that what vapours are converted into water, may after exhalation be reverted into their own Original. So, when we would keep any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared meats warm, or being cold, heat them, we cover the diſhes, in which they are with others; whereby the vapours ariſing from them by their cold, incraſſate <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> fall down again in drops.</p>
               <p>Alſo Diſtillation, with reſpect to the diverſity of veſſels wherein it is made (not to mention many other differences) is either right or oblique. It is made by Alembeck, or <hi>per Veſicam,</hi> or elſe by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, eſpecially in things containing the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Hereto appertains Rectification and Coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>Rectification<note place="margin">Rectification.</note> is a repeated diſtillation of Liquors, for their greater purification and exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet this is alſo ſometimes performed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
               <p>Cohobation<note place="margin">Cohobation.</note> is a reiteration of diſtillations, wherein the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor diſtilled is reverted upon its own feces, and again thence diſtilled.

               <p>Extraction generally ſo called, which is made by Deſcention, is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> either hot or cold.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51502:21"/>
               <p>The hot is that wherein the ſubtile parts are ſeparated from the groſs by deſcenſion,<note place="margin">Diſtillation by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion hot.</note> with the mediation of fire. Whence it is alſo called diſtillation by deſcent, and is uſed in making of Pitch; when from the heap of Clefts of the Pitch-tree piled together, and cloſed from any breathing places by fire kindled within, Pitch floweth out; as is to be ſeen in <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Deliquium</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deliquium.</note> is, when impure Calxes, Salts, and ſuch like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quables, either <hi>per ſe</hi> are put upon a Marble or Glaſs Table inclined; or inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a bag are ſuſpended; that moiſtning by the humid Air, they may let go their pure juice. Yet ſometimes it ſo is, as <hi>per deliquium,</hi> there is no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of parts made; as when Salts purified, or ſuch like are placed in a cold Cellar or other moiſt place, and by external humidity, which eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into them, deſcend and fall into a ſubjacent veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in Liquor.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51502:21"/>
               <p>Extraction which is made by an intermedium, is when the more pure parts of Liquids or dry things moiſtened, are ſeparated from the impure without diſtillation and ſublimation.</p>
               <p>Of this there are three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Digeſtion, Putrefaction, and Circulation.</p>
               <p>Digeſtion<note place="margin">Digeſtion.</note> is, when things with digeſtive heat, reſembling the heat of natural digeſtion in the Stomach are cocted or ripened.</p>
               <p>For as the Stomach by its own moderate heat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth crude meats received, and by cocting tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes it into Chyle; that, the feces being ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and thruſt out into the Inteſtines, from that ſubſtance by the Liver an extraction of the more benign and more pure parts, may be made; ſo alſo by like temperate heat of any other thing, digeſtion ſeparates the ſubtile from the groſs; what are thick it breaks and attenuates, cocts the crude, mit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igates and edulcorates the unſavoury; and ſo elaborates all things, that from things digeſted, a more plentiful Harveſt of eſſence is always to be expected.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtration thereof, is Learnedly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Libavius</hi> in this manner. The matter to be digeſted is included in a veſſel like unto the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, every where firmly cloſed; unleſs when with digeſtion evaporation is conjoyned, as for correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or in coagulation, and ſuch like; for then a ſmall hole in the cover or mouth of the veſſel is left, and a juſt time obſerved, that none of the ſubſtance periſh. Whether it be meer juice or Liquor, the matter is plain: but in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutal of Herbs, and ſuch like, either the proper juice is to be left, or ſome analogous humour from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51502:22"/> without is to be added; which notwithſtanding is ſometimes alſo in liquors of divers kinds; as when Oils are digeſted with Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where is a proneneſs to putrefaction, and in adding the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> care enough can hardly be taken; (for putrefaction muſt not be made when we would digeſt a thing, although digeſtion may be the way to it) then Salt is to be added; and the veſſel ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, muſt be placed in a digeſtory furnace of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent heat, and there permitted to ſtand unto the deſired end, which is diverſe, by reaſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicite uſe of digeſtion. As for example: Green Herbs moiſtned with their own juice, from which, by diſtillation their Eſſence is to be extracted, are macerated three days; but the dry moiſtned with Spirit of wine ſeven days. Seeds and Aromaticks half a Moneth: Roots for a Moneth if they be dry: Minerals for a philoſophick moneth,<note place="margin">A Philoſophick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</note> which is forty days or longer, according to firmneſs, and the hability of the <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Some are twice macerated, ſprinkled with Greek-wine, as ſometimes Aromaticks, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moiſtned, are digeſted to a dryneſs; afterward pulveriſate, are the ſecond time macerated by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition. So ſolidity and rarity alſo have their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time. Diſtilled Waters ſet in digeſtion to the Sun, are rectifyed in half a Moneth, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being firmly cloſed, and two parts of the veſſel ful, and the third empty; and ſometimes a third part of the glaſs is ſet in ſand, which in cold things Artificers command to be done, but with great caution. Yet hot waters and Oils are rectifyed in cold ſand, alſo a third part of the veſſel buryed in

               <p>And here if the humour be alienate, it is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the aforeſaid hole; but if otherwiſe, and it be familiar, or elſe alterable into the nature of the digeſted, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But what are moſt hard, as Stones, muſt firſt be calcined, and afterward fermented; as in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, touching Corals and Lead, ſhall be ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Extraction ſpecially ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Extraction ſpecially ſo called.</note> is when from the mixt body, the more ſubtile, and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts drawn but by any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are extracted from the Elementary groſneſs remaining in the bottom; and by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or evaporation are coagulated to the conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Syrup or <hi>Sapa.</hi> It is thus made: When a matter having Tincture is infuſed in a convenient <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and the veſſel cloſe ſhut, placed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion: Afterward the coloured <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination ſeparated; and other freſh <hi>Menſtruum</hi> poured on, and the veſſel cloſed, again ſet to digeſt, and the ſame labour ſo oft repeated, as till the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> be no more tinged.

                  <p>There are three kinds of Vitriol; the Green, White, and Blew, participating of the nature of Salts, Alloms, and Sulphurs, ſome more, and ſome leſs. The firſt indeed participates more of Salt, the ſecond of Allom, and the third of Sulphur; and they conſiſt of an aqueous, earthy, and middle nature, the aqueous and earthy, as <hi>Ripley</hi> witneſſeth in his Pupil of Alchimy, cannot be ſeparated from their extremities, but by the mediation of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which, as <hi>Geber</hi> affirms, retains what is of its
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51502:33"/> own nature, rejecting and expoſing to the fire, what is not ſo. The middle perſpicuous ſubſtance exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſublimation, into a Snow-like candor, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly in it ſelf contains a ſulphurious ſeed, moſt Red, like a ſmall worm. Whence in <hi>Turba</hi> it is ſaid, Philoſophers have admired, that a redneſs ſhould be exiſtant in ſo great whiteneſs. Of this Sulphur <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> thus ſpeaketh; in <hi>cap.</hi> 28. <hi>Summ.</hi> By the moſt high GOD, that thing illuminates and rectifies all bodies, becauſe it is Allom, and Tincture. This is that <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the dry water which wetteth not the hands, the congealed water, the animate Salt; touching which <hi>Raymund Lully</hi> after <hi>Alphidius</hi> ſaith, ſalt is no other than fire; nor fire any other than ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, nor ſulphur other than Argent-<hi>vive,</hi> reduced into that precious, celeſtial, incorruptible ſubſtance, which we call our ſtone. Whence one to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>VITRIOLUM</hi> thus alludes. <hi>Viſitando Interiora Terrae Rectificando, Invenies Occultum Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Veram Medicinam:</hi> that is, viſiting the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts of the earth, by rectifying you may find the occult ſtone, the true Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, among Artiſts it is controverted, whether among the various kinds of Vitriol, either that of Cyprus, the Romane, or Hungarick, be the better, and more noble.

The ſame is likewiſe affirmed of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,<note place="margin">Ungarick Antimony genuine, is ſeldom brought into other Regions.</note> which is found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance in the Gold Mines.</p>
                  <p>That Vitriol, of right, and deſervedly, ought to be cenſured moſt excellent, which by the benefit of water is made of <hi>Venus,</hi> and thence extracted, as is mentioned hear-after. To this, the blew aforeſaid is ſomewhat inferiour; for this contains in it ſelf more of <hi>Sol;</hi> tranſmutes more of <hi>Mars</hi> into <hi>Venus;</hi> and longer ſuſtains the <hi>Examen</hi> of fire, before it gives forth its laſt ſpirits, from what place ſoever it is brought.</p>
                  <p>Therefore of this Vitriol ℞. twelve pound, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine it in an earthen veſſel with moderate fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till all its humidity recede. The veſſel cooled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Maſs, which will be about ſeven pound, to powder very fine, and with one pound or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts of the ſame Teſt [where it was calcined] pulveriſate, put it into a Retort firmly coated; which muſt be ſo large, as at leaſt a third part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51502:34"/> may be empty. Then place it in a Reverberato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furnace, apply a large Recipient, with a ſhort neck likewiſe coated, and diligently cloſe the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Retort with the Receiver, with Salt Luting. Then above the Retort place a broad co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of earth of one foot high, and quadrangularly perforate in the top [or upper part] being made exactly to cloſe the mouth of the furnace, of what form ſoever it be, whether ſquare or round, exactly fitted in altitude convenient, and to cloſe or ſhut in the mouth of the furnace equally on every ſide; that the vacant place between the Retort and the cover may be filled with coals. Which being done, make a quadrangular draught with four pieces of Tile, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſquare hole of the cover, that the flame by help of ſuch a vehicle, may, when time ſerves, more freely aſcend. The Orifice of the draught, as alſo the furnace door and aſh hole, muſt be ſo cloſed, as for the firſt four hours, the coals in the furnace may but juſt burn, without being extinguiſhed; by which the Retort being leiſurely and ſucceſſively heated, then for the following four hours, the heat may be encreaſed, by gradually, and by little and little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hour opening the holes above and below, until the flame begin to break out in the ſuperiour part, and the Retort wax hot all over, the aſh hole and draught being altogether open, and no way ſtopped; the fire muſt be intended eighteen or twenty hours, untill all the ſpirits be come forth. After two days, moiſten the Salt Luting, wherewith the Retort and Recipient were joyned, with a wet cloath keept on for an hour, becauſe it will be ſo very hard, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moiſtning it cannot be removed without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the Glaſſes; then may you ſafely take off the Receiver. Which being done, by diſtillation in

But there is one thing remarkable, and worthy of admiration, <hi>viz.</hi> that although the bordering Towns and people of <hi>Idria,</hi> are almoſt every year afflicted with a Peſtiferous <hi>Lues,</hi> yet from this evil they ſometimes are wont to be wholly free, which (I going to that place about eight years ſince) was confirmed to me by the people, that a certain man of a very great age had obſerved it ſo in himſelf, and had received like Information from his Anceſtors. From whence, as well as from other innumerable examples, it is found that Mercury is an <hi>Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macon</hi> againſt all corruption, and putrefaction. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo no leſs ſtupendious, and nigh to a prodigy, is that which I there noted: There was a decrepit Old man, who, having ſpent the whole time of his Life in preparing cinnabar, did perpetually tremble; and he did ſo dealbate gold coin, by compreſſing it in his hand, as the native colour thereof did wholly diſappear.</p>
               <p>There is alſo other Mercury found in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called <hi>Gimnavoda,</hi> ſix miles diſtant from <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> between <hi>Tarnava, Ribie,</hi> and <hi>Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letzky,</hi> which at certain times of the year breaks out on the ſuperficies of the earth, eſpecially in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal quarter. Yet about the Feaſt of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> I there gathered many grains like Peaſe in the roots of green things. But this Mercury is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51502:51"/> and far inferiour to that of <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> The natural is alſo found in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, and ſometimes in Gold and Silver Mines.</p>
               <p>The Artificial,<note place="margin">Artificial Mercury.</note> and its way of preparing is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known to Artiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> by reſuſitative ſalts, as well from middle Minerals as Metals.

Whence <hi>Hydrargyry</hi> is ſaid to be the Mother of metals, and ſulphur the Father. And in theſe are repreſented the four Elements, which are the remote matter of all natural bodies. For Mercury, as Feminine cold, and humid, holds the property of water, and air; and ſulphur, as maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, hot, and dry, bears the repreſentation of Fire and Earth. If any ſhall affirm, that as well of the vapour, as juicyneſs [found in Mines] the matter of metals conſiſts, I will not gainſay it. For when I, the laſt Summer, in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> deſcended into the Silver Mine in <hi>Schemnitz,</hi> about fifteen hundred Cubits deep; I Learned of the Miners, (who, by reaſon of the exceeding heat of the Mine, did work without any cloaths, not having ſo much as a ſhirt upon their naked bodies) that Mineral vapours did frequently ariſe from the center of the earth, and extinguiſh their lights, and themſelves alſo, if they did not make haſte away: and that, ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they entred the Pit, they ſhould find thoſe damps or vapours coagulated into a maſs to the ſides of the wall; which with a gentle touch, would be fluid, as oil. Whence it may ſafely be inferred, that the vapour is the more remote matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but the ſulphureous and mercurial juice, the more near matter of the ſame. Alſo I have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me, mineral Stones (from the ſame Mine, and others) which either the vapour, or ſuch an unctuous humid mineral juice hath penetrated; and in ſome of them is plainly to be ſeen, a crude matter, not ſufficiently cocted; in others mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately cocted, from one pound of which, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. of pure ſilver may be taken, and about ℈<hi>ſs.</hi> of Gold. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is matter perfectly decocted, ſo as the ſilver
<pb facs="tcp:51502:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> is viſible on the ſuperficies, and in one vein ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of pure gold may be beheld. Although there be ſome, who, by reaſon of certain frivolous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, deny Mercury and ſulphur to be the matter of metal; yet Phyloſophers, who have experience in metals, believe the ſame, and that ſuch a matter is found in all Mines and veins of the earth, do with one conſent witneſs.

Likewiſe Phyſicians know, that all diſeaſes of ſuch as labour in Mines, ariſe from the admiſſion of crude, ſulphureous, and mercurial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the body: and that metals in external af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, perform the ſame that Mercury doth.

               <head type="sub">Of the Quinteſſence of humane Bloud.</head>
               <p>THE denomination of Quinteſſence, is variouſly taken. Sometimes it ſignifies any Chymical Species, which hath put off the Elementary groſſeneſs of matter, and corpulent feces: and is oppoſed to a Magiſtery, in which almoſt the whole bulk of its ſubſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, only it is exalted, and purifyed. Sometimes alſo, as we here take it, it denotes an Aethereal, Celeſtial, and moſt ſubtile ſubſtance; taken from the three principles of any mixt body diſſolved, freed by various Chymical Operations from their Elementary, Senſible, Corruptible, and Mortal
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51502:69"/> quality, and coagulated either into one ſpiritual body, or a corporeal ſpirit. It is by ſome called Medicine, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that is, by reaſon of its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency. By others Elixir, by reaſon of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous virtues, it exerciſeth in preſervation of the humane body, from ſundry diſeaſes. By others, Heaven, for a double reaſon; Firſt, becauſe, as Heaven conſiſts not of the four Elements, but is made of a certain Aethereal matter, and as it were a fift Element; and is not obnoxious to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo alſo the true Quinteſſence is ſeparated from all feces of Elements; and although it be not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incorruptible, yet it is reduced to that ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, tenuity, and ſpiritual ſimplicity, that it ſeems to contain in it ſelf nothing of heterogeneity, by which it ſhould be corrupted. Secondly, becauſe, as Heaven powerfully acts on theſe ſublunary things, contributing Life to all, and conſerving them: ſo alſo this Quinteſſence conſerves the health of the humane body, prolongs youth, retards Age, and expelleth every diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The Quinteſſence of humane bloud, is in this manner prepared. ℞. A great quantity of the bloud of ſound men in the flower of their Age. Put it in Circulatory veſſels of a convenient magnitude, which place in <hi>B. M.</hi> continually boiling until the Dragon ſhall have devoured his own tail. The veſſels cooled, take out the matter, which will be like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and cut it to pieces very ſmal. And in high Cucurbits, with the ſame heat of Baln. by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeparate the aqueous element or phlegm. The diſtilled Liquor repour upon its earth, and ſet it in the former circulatory veſſels, in a boiling Baln. for ten days as before. Repeating the ſame proceſs five times; and the laſt time keep all the diſtilled
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51502:70"/> phlegm. The veſſels being cooled, take out the matter, and put it into a large Retort, applying a capacious Receiver; in aſhes diſtil off the air by fire gradually encreaſed. The ſmal and thin clouds in the recipient diſſolving, intend the fire ſo, as the Element of fire may alſo come forth in form of Red or Purple oil. Toward the end a little Salt armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack will ſublime it ſelf. The veſſels being cold, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the air or ſpirit from the fire or oil; either by gentle diſtillation in Baln. or by a Separatory. The ſpirit with the Salt armoniack, again pour upon the feces, digeſt them for three days, then by a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort diſtil off the ſpirit, toward the end giving fire apt for ſublimation, that the whole ſpiritual ſalt, or at leaſt the greater part thereof may be ſublimed, and mixed with the ſpirit in the Receptory. Again pour new ſpirit upon the feces, digeſt and diſtil as above; ſo often, as until the earth be deprived of its ſoul; which you ſhall know, if when put upon a burning plate, it fume not.</p>
               <p>Note, That before the ſpirit be animated, it muſt be ſeven times rectifyed, every time ſeparating the phlegm and feces: and part thereof reſerved for preparing the diſſolvent, as afterward ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>Calcine the black blacker than black in a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratory fornace with moderate fire, in a veſſel eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where cloſed, for the ſpace of five days, until the blackneſs be turned to a yellowiſh whiteneſs, and ſo into a red colour. Then will the earth be apt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving its animate ſpirit. Digeſt it by Baln. as long as ſhall be ſufficient, afterward by gentle diſtillation ſeparate the inſipid humidity. Which being done; revert upon the earth a ninth part of its animate ſpirit, digeſt and diſtil as before. Then give it the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51502:70"/> eighth part of the animate ſpirit; afterward the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the ſixth, the fifth, the fourth part; ſo long with the fourth part imbibing it as til the earth be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to double of its own weight, before imbibition. And this is what <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, know, that the earth muſt be nouriſhed, firſt with a little of its own water, and afterward with more, as is ſeen in edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Infants. Therefore often grind the earth, and leiſurely imbibe the ſame, from eight days to eight days. Decoct it, and afterward moderately calcine it in fire. And let not this Labour ſeem te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to thee, in ſo many reiterations; for the earth brings not forth fruit, without frequent moiſtnings. Yet be wary leaſt you too haſtily imbibe the earth, but do it leiſurely, by little, and a little, and with long contrition after the earth is dryed. Wherefore in this the weight is diligently to be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt too much dryneſs or ſuperfluous humidity cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the work. And much coct it by aſſation, as by imbibing the diſſolution requires. Thus far <hi>Avicen.</hi> Whence alſo <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith: There<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Put the aforeſaid earth into an high cucurbit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Alembick, and receiver annexed; the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures being very firmly cloſed, ſo as nothing may reſpire; give to it fire of aſhes for the ſpace of three days, until the clean and white fume aſcend, and cleave to the ſides of the cucurbit like Talck.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51502:72"/> know, that the ſoul ſoon hath ingreſs into its own body, which with another body, can by no means be conjoyned. Having this ſign, cover the veſſel, and to it placed in aſhes, adminiſter fire for the ſpace of two days, until the vegetable ſulphur ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the ſides of the veſſel like Talck. Of this ſulphur ℞. ℥j. Of the pure ſpirit ℥ iij. Mix and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt them for one day natural, then diſtil them in aſhes, cohobating often, until the whole body ſhall aſcend. After which, twice diſtil it in a boiling Baln. and circulate it for ſixty days. And having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the <hi>Hypeſtaſis</hi> (which will adhere about the bottom of the Pellican) keep the Quinteſſence of wine for curing infinite diſeaſes, to be uſed both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally and externally.</p>
               <p>Alſo this Quinteſſence of wine may be perfected in a ſhorter ſpace of time. Yea when I did this, in the preſence and ſight of certain of my diſciples, in the ſpace of five weeks I finiſhed it: and with the ſame extracted a moſt red Tincture of Gold. For, as <hi>Geber</hi> witneſſeth, there are many ways to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing one effect, and one intent: But</p>
               <p>In this place, I can never ſufficiently admire, why <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germane</hi> wine circulated, have not that admirable odour, which <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi> attributes to <hi>Neapolitan</hi> wine, in theſe words.—Then open the mouth of the veſſel, and if ſuch an admirable fragrancy iſſue out, as with it nothing may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; know that you are come to the deſired end. But if the odour or colour anſwer not, cloſe the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel again; and re-place it to be circulated, until you ſhall have the aforeſaid ſign. Nor is the <hi>Italian</hi> ſpirit of wine endued with ſuch an odour, as <hi>Rubens</hi> teſtifies. For he in the ſecond Chap. of the ſecond Sect. on of his book of diſtillation, in this manner
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51502:72"/> writeth. I would that good Man, and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Phyſician, <hi>Euſtachius Sancto Severinas,</hi> had now lived. For he (not to ſpeak of my own knowledge) could have evinced, by his experience moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently acquired, that <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi> if circulated, not only for a moneth, but for two or three moneths; yea, for a whole year, as <hi>Raymund</hi> preſcribes, can never be deduced to that ſweetneſs of odour, but rather will be found more hot, and be rendred more acid; as who ſo will, may eaſily prove; and reaſon it ſelf by obſervation of the fire and motion, perſwades the ſame. But <hi>Raymund</hi> did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or intend that of ſimple and pure <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi> as ſome of late have thought; but of that, in which the metallick body was diſſolved. For in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Canon of the firſt book, he thus writeth: But this Quinteſſence ſo circulated and rectifyed, will not poſſeſs ſuch an odour, unleſs the body be diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it. Whence it appears, that <hi>Porta</hi> drew not ſuch a Quinteſſence of wine from his Labour in the fire, but from the writings of <hi>Lully,</hi> and <hi>John de Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſciſsa,</hi> evilly underſtood.</p>

And the ſalts impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the ſalt armoniack of vinegar, muſt be fermented in vapour of an hot Baln. and there left until a ſtrong odour and black colour appear, which are the ſigns of true putrefaction.

The way of calcination of ſpirits is, that unto them being nigh to fixation, fire be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively adminiſtred, and encreaſed by degrees, that they fly not until they come to be able to abide the greateſt fire; and the veſſel containing them, muſt be of glaſs, round in the bottom, and indifferent thick, and well cloſed, that it melt not.

After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the veſſel being open, give fire to it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that the black feces may be made of an Aſh colour. From which a ſalt with the former reſerved phlegm, muſt be extracted, which filter and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
